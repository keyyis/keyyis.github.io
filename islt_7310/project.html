<h3>Welcome to Nebi's Portfolio website</h3>
<nav></nav>
  <main><p>My name is Nebi Sevim. I am a high school <em>physics teacher</em> and <em>EdTech coach</em> of our high and middle school in Columbus,OH. I worked in several in European countries in international schools mainly teaching A level and IB physics. The last one before moving to Ohio was in Transylvania, Romania.<br /> Over the years of teaching physics which is considered to be one the toughest high school subject, I have experienced that the more I implement technology into my instruction,the more students are engaged in my challenging physics courses. I chose to pursue an educational specialist degree in learning technologies and design at the University of Missouri, in order to learn how to do that in the best possible academic ways.</p>
<blockquote>The Learning Technologies and Design (LTD)degree culminates in a Web-based portfolio showing mastery of competencies based on the Learning Technologies and Design Program goals and objectives. This portfolio is used as the comprehensive exam at the end of the program of study which presents my products and process artifacts in this program.</blockquote></main>
