<h1 style="text-align: center">Program Reflection</h1>
<p><span style="font-size:36px;  color: #333333;">B</span>efore applying to this program, I have been teaching high school
    physics for more than 20 years.Without any doubt, physics is one
    of the most challenging subjects at high school level. As the saying
    goes, necessity is the mother of invention and I was in need of making
    this challenging course more engaging to my students.Over all the years
    of teaching,I have experienced that the more I implement technology into
    my instruction, the more the students are engaged. </p>

<p class="ind-prg">However, simply using technology tools in any unordered way would make instruction
    maybe a little more entertaining but not never effective by any means.
    This is the reason Learning Technologies and Design was the best match for my needs.
    I had the chance to learn how to put theories of design and instruction into practice
    in an academic way.</p>

<p class="ind-prg">Personally, I have always been fascinated by the idea of design.
    I have always started my first day of school by discussing the scope
    of physics and how it deals with the beauty in nature.
    As Henri Poincaré, a pioneer scientist, said : “The scientist does not study
    nature because it is useful; he studies it because he delights in it, and
    he delights in it because it is beautiful. If nature were not beautiful,
    it would not be worth knowing, and if nature were not worth knowing,
    life would not be worth living.” Felix Mendelssohn defines beauty as ‘unity in variety’
    which actually points to a design.Finally,Carl Sagan says “The beauty of a living
    thing is not the atoms that go into it, but the way those atoms are put together.” ;
    a minute change in the design of the atoms would end up with another substance.</p>

<p class="ind-prg">This is true for knowledge and information as well! This program helped
    me to see the best practices of design in this sense.
    I have also learned how important aligning every assessment
    and learning activity of a course to the objectives is. </p>
