Hi everyone! My name is Nebi Sevim. I am a high school physics teacher and EdTech coach of our high school in Columbus,OH. I was born in Mersin,Turkey. It’s a coastal resort and port town by the Mediterranean coast with several historical sites dating back to the twelfth century BC. It’s also the birthplace of St.Paul, the Apostle and the place where Antony and Cleopatra met the first time. Historians say the coast was given by Mark Antohony to Cleopatra as a wedding present. :)
This is the last course that I am taking for an educational specialist degree and hopefully, by successfully completing it, I am expecting to learn the fundamentals of web development in order to help learners and instructors teach and learn better.I have very little experience before. In my free time, I like hiking,exploring nature,reading and spending time with my family.
