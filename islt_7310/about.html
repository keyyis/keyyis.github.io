<h3>Welcome to Nebi's Portfolio website</h3>

  <main><p>My name is Nebi Sevim. I am a high school <em>physics teacher</em> and <em>EdTech coach</em> of our high and middle school in Columbus,OH. I worked in several in European countries in international schools mainly teaching A level and IB physics. The last one before moving to Ohio was in Transylvania, Romania.<br /> Over the years of teaching physics which is considered to be one the toughest high school subject, I have experienced that the more I implement technology into my instruction,the more students are engaged in my challenging physics courses. I chose to pursue an educational specialist degree in learning technologies and design at the University of Missouri, in order to learn how to do that in the best possible academic ways. As the great scientist Carl Sagan says:</p>
    <blockquote>“The <strong>beauty</strong> of a living thing is not the
    atoms that go into it, but the way those atoms are put together.”</blockquote></main>
